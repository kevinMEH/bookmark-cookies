## Injecting Cookies

To inject cookies on a desktop browser, simply open up Developer Tools, navigate to the console, and paste the string in.

On mobile devices, you'll need to use a bookmark. Go to the page that you want to inject cookies to, create a new bookmark, and in the URL section, paste the injection script in. Then, use the bookmark, and reload the page if necessary. This works on most browsers, including Safari and Chrome.
